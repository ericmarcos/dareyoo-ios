Roadmap:

Setup + Models + basic tests = 10 hours (2 weeks)

Initial business logic + tests =  4 hours (1 week)

Sign In + Registration Screens + tests + try RAC = 18 hours (2 weeks)

Social integration = 4-6 hours (1 week) (haven't played with fb recently)

Bet list = 12 hours (2 weeks)

Bet Detail = 24 hours (4 weeks)

Create Bet = 8 hours (1 week)

Notifications = 4 hours (less than a week)

Push Notifications = 4 hours (1 week)


Total = 90 hours (10-20 more for final testing, and the fact that screens are not fully designed) = 110 hours.
